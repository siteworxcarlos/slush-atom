> Generator to scaffold an atom and corresponding scss in Pattern Lab


## Getting Started

Install `slush-atom` globally:

```bash
$ npm install -g slush-atom
```

### Usage

Create a new atom for your Pattern Lab:

Include a `slush-atom-config.json` file in your project (use the one here as a template) where you run the `slush atom` command from to configure custom behavior.

## Getting To Know Slush

Slush is a tool that uses Gulp for project scaffolding.

Slush does not contain anything "out of the box", except the ability to locate installed slush generators and to run them with liftoff.

To find out more about Slush, check out the [documentation](https://github.com/slushjs/slush).
